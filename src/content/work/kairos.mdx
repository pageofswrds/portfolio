Kairōs is a tool to track the planets. There are a handful of tools out there, but I've found that they are generally unsatisfying. Their UIs are clunky, their data models are limiting—and for such a complex niche, I felt there was room for a better tool.

There is a growing contingent of people who are picking up on the surprising consistency of astrological study. Over and over, we see that patterns in the sky seem to parallel patterns in real life. But worldview aside, **my goal here is to illustrate the needs of a growing market.**

Generally, there are two user-groups in this industry: clients, and professional readers. Typically:
- **Clients** are everyday people looking for advice; they want to understand who they are, and the experiences they're going through. It's sort of like a directed therapy session.
- **Professionals** often go through years of guided study, before rendering their services to people. They need complex tooling that helps them analyze the geometry in the sky—which enables them to craft a story about their client's life.

**As a result, we see a divergence into two different types of software**: (1) lowest common denominator horoscope generators, and (2) feature-packed professional tooling with a high barrier-to-entry. There isn't much in-between. So—as more and more people show interest in learning how to read the stars, it presents a clear market-gap for something to bridge that gap.

*This transit could be interpreted as a cutting of ties. Though the specifics depend on your natal chart, the general guidance is that the future is uncertain; to navigate it, you might find going with your gut is more reliable than cold hard data. (Which makes sense, given the recent launch of Nano Banana Pro...)*

What Kairōs is NOT, is a tool that commodifies astrological practice. This app is not intended to simply hand people the answers. Rather, its purpose is to train people to tell their own stories. And the way it does this, is by orienting its features around *communicating* the *mechanics* of an astrology chart.

The problem with most professional tools is that it's not always a good idea to show clients what you're looking at. The core tension is in how much visual information is being shown; on the one hand, professionals need to see dense amounts of information to do their job. On the other, all that information can be *extremely* overwhelming for people who don't know what they're looking at.

This makes it really hard to explain how you arrive at an interpretation. And that's a problem! Because ultimately, the entire purpose of this practice is to help people understand themselves better. If the client does not understand the mechanics, it will be harder for them to assess what did or did not resonate.

Kairōs addresses this through **Display Profiles**—a feature that gives users precise controls over how the chart is styled. More to the point, these controls are central to the user experience. Users can rapidly switch between profiles (via the marking menu pattern), and edit them in a live view. No other application prioritizes it in this way; while customization may exist, the controls are clunky and settings scattered all over the place. But Kairōs is designed to make it easy to visually emphasize specific relationships in the sky.

Ultimately, Kairōs is a professional-grade tool that is fine-tuned to study the *motion* of the planets. With some behind-the-scenes math + highly optimized caching, the app is able to not only show the planets in motion—but is able to calculate the exact moments when planets reach certain configurations.

Surprisingly, existing tools are poorly equipped for this purpose.

In modern western astrological practice, the main thing we look for are moments when planets make precise geometric angles with each other. We call these **aspects**; configurations at 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150° and 180°. But as far as I'm aware, Kairōs is the only software that can calculate these moments on the fly.

This feature is like, a superpower, when it comes to researching critical moments in time. While other apps require you to fiddle around and guestimate those moments, Kairōs is literally designed around this. And there is a loooot of cool stuff we can do with this foundation.

I am currently running an open beta for iOS 17+, to generate as much feedback as possible. At time of writing, I have around ~20 active testers who are providing valuable feedback. I'm aiming to launch in January next year; if you would like to learn more, please shoot me an email at pageofswrds @ zojer.studio.
